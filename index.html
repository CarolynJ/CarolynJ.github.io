                Learning to code is improving my strategic thinking. Programming gives me an opportunity to spend time solving problems everyday.
                Building applications one step at a time is enormously satisfying.

                I am passionate about my work.  I care about the quality of outcomes,
                as well as the people and processes involved in getting there.
                I love debating ideas, making new connections, balancing equations,
                watching everything fall into place (after a fair amout of hard work).

                I have always had a very practical approach to getting things done and
                enjoy thinking through solutions to complex problems. Some of the most rewarding
                and challenging work of my career has involved finding creative solutions to address tough questions.

                        As a marker researcher, I regularly evaluated emerging technologies and mobile platforms to determine the best
                        data collection methods to meet our client's needs.

                        In grad school, I crafted a business plan outlining how city government agencies can
                        collaborate to address childhood obesity on an environmental level.

                        As a Peace Corps volunteer, I discovered how malnourished children can be identified
                        and how a community can work together to improve nutrition.
